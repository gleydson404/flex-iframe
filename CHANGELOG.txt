 Revision  Date      Who           Notes
 --------  ----      ---           -----
 1.0       16/09/07  AJR           * Initial version
 
 1.1       29/09/07  AJR           * Fixed bug where the frame wasn't resizing itself when
                                     the source url was assigned.
                              
 1.2       14/12/07  Max           * http://16-bits.com/HTMLTest/HTMLTest.html
                                     I modified it a little bit so that you can also set 
                                     a content property instead of source to display a div 
                                     container instead of iFrame.
                              
 1.3       22/09/08  RAB           * Frame will now move with the Flex component
                                     (for example, dragging a popup TitleWindow parent)
                                     It does this by seeding a second event listener up
                                     the displayList for MoveEvent.MOVE

                                   * Fixed issue where frame might not display if it
                                     was visible at component creation and not a child 
                                     of a navigator control like TabNavigator,
                                     ViewStack or Accordion

                                   * IFrame now registers an onLoad callback for its
                                     iframe element and will dispatch a 'frameLoad' flash
                                     event when the browser reports iframe content load

                                   * Added callIFrameFunction that allows calling of
                                     JavaScript functions defined on the IFrame content's
                                     document object, if everything is in the same domain
                                     (if the iframe hasn't fully loaded yet, the call will
                                     be queued and executed once it has loaded)

                                   * Added option for IFrame component to try and detect
                                     new global objects such as alerts, tooltips and 
                                     pop up windows that are added on top of it and hide the
                                     browser iframe temporarily. This option must be
                                     explicitly enabled with the overlayDetection property
                                     as it's a total hack with no guarantees of working

                                   * Added 'debug' property to component that can be
                                     used to switch trace statements on and off and
                                     changed all traces to go through a logger

                                   * Added property "loadIndicatorClass". If this is
                                     defined, iframe will create an instance of this
                                     class and use it to display a centered indicator
                                     over the iframe container while its contents are
                                     being loaded by the browser

                                   * IFrame will now ensure that it's using a unique
                                     id within the application by tracking all IFrame
                                     component ids in use with a static var and
                                     appending a unique number to the end if needed.
                                     This allows use of IFrame within a reusable MXML 
                                     component that gets instantiated more than once

 1.3.1     13/10/08  RAB           * Fixed issue where parent document body could be
                                     accidentally set to invisible when using content
                                     div mode

 1.3.2     20/10/08  RAB           * Added checks for cross-domain security violations.
                                     Fixes a problem with hiding and showing iframes with
                                     content from a different domain, and will now log
                                     a warning in debug mode when attempting to call 
                                     a function inside an iframe in a different domain

 1.3.3     05/11/08  RAB           * Fixed issue where iframe in nested ViewStacks (or
                                     related components like TabNavigator) could become 
                                     visible when it shouldn't.
                              
                                   * Debug mode can now be turned on or off at any time
                                     instead of being locked in when createChildren runs
                            
                                   * Fixed issue with incorrect switching when iframe
                                     was created in ViewStack child on the fly due to
                                     creationPolicy="auto"

 1.3.4     03/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Fixed issue where assignment using the content 
                                     property was causing the DIV to ignore the container 
                                     size. DIV now uses overflow:auto; with explicit size. (fix
                                     by chrisr, Issue 12).

                                   * Fixed DIVs never removed (Issue 1, fix by alan.plante).

                                   * Fixed issue when moving IFrame (Issue 29, fix by
                                     achim.alin.ion).

                                   * Fixed IFrame contents were reloaded at every visibility change
                                     (Issue 32, fix by Savas Ali Tokmen)
                                     
           07/10/09 J. Nicoulaud   * Added a function to bring an IFrame to the front (Issue 35,
                                     function written by artistinclosure).
                                     
                                   * Use Application.application.url instead of BrowserManager to
                                     avoid adding an extra history state to the browser (Issue 19,
                                     fix by Bruce Schwartz).
