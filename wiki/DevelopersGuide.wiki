= Get Flex-IFrame sources =
Follow the instructions [http://code.google.com/p/flex-iframe/source/checkout here].

= Build Flex-IFrame =

== Using Flex/Flash builder ==
You can import the `library` module and each of the examples as Flex projects.

== Using Maven ==
This is the preferred way to build Flex-IFrame, because it does much more than just compiling the SWC: it runs unit tests, generates the asdoc, builds the examples, packages the sources and the assembly you can find on the on the download page.

To build the project, you must have [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Maven]. Then just run the following command at the root of the project:
{{{
mvn clean install
}}}
