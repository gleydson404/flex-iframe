 --------  --------  -----------   -----------------------------------------------------------------
 Revision  Date      Who           Notes
 --------  --------  -----------   -----------------------------------------------------------------
 1.0       16/09/07  AJR           * Initial version
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           29/09/07  AJR           * Fixed bug where the frame wasn't resizing itself when
 1.1                                 the source url was assigned.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           14/12/07  Max           * http://16-bits.com/HTMLTest/HTMLTest.html
                                     I modified it a little bit so that you can also set
                                     a content property instead of source to display a div
 1.2                                 container instead of iFrame.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           22/09/08  RAB           * Frame will now move with the Flex component
                                     (for example, dragging a popup TitleWindow parent)
                                     It does this by seeding a second event listener up
                                     the displayList for MoveEvent.MOVE.

                                   * Fixed issue where frame might not display if it
                                     was visible at component creation and not a child
                                     of a navigator control like TabNavigator,
                                     ViewStack or Accordion.

                                   * IFrame now registers an onLoad callback for its
                                     iframe element and will dispatch a 'frameLoad' flash
                                     event when the browser reports iframe content load.

                                   * Added callIFrameFunction that allows calling of
                                     JavaScript functions defined on the IFrame content's
                                     document object, if everything is in the same domain
                                     (if the iframe hasn't fully loaded yet, the call will
                                     be queued and executed once it has loaded).

                                   * Added option for IFrame component to try and detect
                                     new global objects such as alerts, tooltips and
                                     pop up windows that are added on top of it and hide the
                                     browser iframe temporarily. This option must be
                                     explicitly enabled with the overlayDetection property
                                     as it's a total hack with no guarantees of working.

                                   * Added 'debug' property to component that can be
                                     used to switch trace statements on and off and
                                     changed all traces to go through a logger.

                                   * Added property "loadIndicatorClass". If this is
                                     defined, iframe will create an instance of this
                                     class and use it to display a centered indicator
                                     over the iframe container while its contents are
                                     being loaded by the browser.

                                   * IFrame will now ensure that it's using a unique
                                     id within the application by tracking all IFrame
                                     component ids in use with a static var and
                                     appending a unique number to the end if needed.
                                     This allows use of IFrame within a reusable MXML
 1.3                                 component that gets instantiated more than once.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           13/10/08  RAB           * Fixed issue where parent document body could be
                                     accidentally set to invisible when using content
 1.3.1                               div mode.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           20/10/08  RAB           * Added checks for cross-domain security violations.
                                     Fixes a problem with hiding and showing iframes with
                                     content from a different domain, and will now log
                                     a warning in debug mode when attempting to call
 1.3.2                               a function inside an iframe in a different domain.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           05/11/08  RAB           * Fixed issue where iframe in nested ViewStacks (or
                                     related components like TabNavigator) could become
                                     visible when it shouldn't.

                                   * Debug mode can now be turned on or off at any time
                                     instead of being locked in when createChildren runs.

                                   * Fixed issue with incorrect switching when iframe
                                     was created in ViewStack child on the fly due to
 1.3.3                               creationPolicy="auto".
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           03/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Fixed issue where assignment using the content
                                     property was causing the DIV to ignore the container
                                     size. DIV now uses overflow:auto; with explicit size. (fix
                                     by chrisr, Issue 12).

                                   * Fixed DIVs never removed (Issue 1, fix by alan.plante).

                                   * Fixed issue when moving IFrame (Issue 29, fix by
                                     achim.alin.ion).

                                   * Fixed IFrame contents were reloaded at every visibility change
 1.3.4                               (Issue 32, fix by Savas Ali Tokmen).
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           07/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Added a function to bring an IFrame to the front (Issue 35,
                                     function written by artistinclosure).

                                   * Use Application.application.url instead of BrowserManager to
                                     avoid adding an extra history state to the browser (Issue 19,
                                     fix by Bruce Schwartz).

           11/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Workaround for Application.application.id being null on Linux
                                     (Issue 34).

                                   * Fixed loading indicator not working (Issue 36).

           12/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Issue 25/37: Handle the browser zoom (Firefox + Chrome).

           14/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Issue 25/37: Handle the browser zoom (Firefox, Chrome, IE8,
                                     Opera, Safari).

                                   * Add a function to print the IFrame (Issue 23, contribution of
 1.3.5                               Jeffery Fernandez).
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           17/10/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Add functions for history back and forward.

                                   * Add the 'hidden' attribute that forces the IFrame to stay
 1.4                                 hidden whatever happens.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           02/11/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Fix settingDict incorrectly filled when child of a container
                                     with creationPolicy="all" (Issue 43, fix by andr.fel).

           07/11/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Issue 40: Handle the browser zoom (IE7).

                                   * Issues 45/47: Fix wrong layout when resizing/maximizing/
 1.4.1                               restoring the browser, by queueing bursts of 'resize' events.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           10/11/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Issue 20: iFrame positioned relative to the swf container and
                                     not the document.

 1.4.2                             * Issue 40: fix iFrame shifted.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           20/11/09  RAB           * The *visible* property will now work more like that of standard
                                     Flex components; i.e. if visible is set to false, the IFrame will
                                     never appear until it is explicitly set back to true. To support
                                     this, I've changed the internal iframe show/hide logic to use a
                                     ower-level private function rather than directly modifying the
                                     visible property. The *hidden* property is now layered on top of
                                     visible and just sets visible to the opposite of the requested
                                     value. I also centralized all rule-based checks for iframe
                                     display in the new private function updateFrameVisibility.

                                   * Enhancements and fixes to overlay detection: resolved some cases
                                     where overlay detection would be ignored and the iframe allowed
                                     to display on top of another flex pop-up, added checks for
                                     existing pop-ups that are in the way when the IFrame is sized by
                                     its parent container, fixed an issue where an IFrame in a pop-up
                                     could detect its own parent as an overlaying object and never
                                     display, and fixed an issue where the same overlaying object
                                     could be counted more than once, preventing the IFrame from
                                     reappearing when it was removed.

 1.4.3     22/11/09  J. Nicoulaud  * Remove 'hidden' property which has no use anymore.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

           19/04/10  RAB           * Added check for stacking order in overlay detection. This prevents
                                     the iframe from detecting floating items behind its own as
                                     overlapping objects, and fixes a bug where it could not be used
                                     in a modal pop-up (because it would detect the modalWindow shield
                                     behind its pop-up as an overlapping object).
                                     
                                   * Fixed issue where overlay checks could run on an item that was
                                     already removed from the display list. This issue could have
                                     caused null errors in new isInFrontOfMe method.

  1.4.4    18/05/10  J. Nicoulaud  * Mavenized the build process.
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
