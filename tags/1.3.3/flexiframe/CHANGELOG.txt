 Revision  Date      Who    Notes

 1.0       16/09/07  AJR    .Initial version
 1.1       29/09/07  AJR    .Fixed bug where the frame wasn't resizing itself
                             when the source url was assigned.
 1.2       14/12/07  Max    .http://16-bits.com/HTMLTest/HTMLTest.html
                             I modified it a little bit so that you can also set 
                             a content property instead of source to display a div 
                             container instead of iFrame.
 1.3       22/09/08  RAB    .Frame will now move with the Flex component
                             (for example, dragging a popup TitleWindow parent)
                             It does this by seeding a second event listener up
                             the displayList for MoveEvent.MOVE

                            .Fixed issue where frame might not display if it
                             was visible at component creation and not a child 
                             of a navigator control like TabNavigator,
                             ViewStack or Accordion

                            .IFrame now registers an onLoad callback for its
                             iframe element and will dispatch a 'frameLoad' flash
                             event when the browser reports iframe content load

                            .Added callIFrameFunction that allows calling of
                             JavaScript functions defined on the IFrame content's
                             document object, if everything is in the same domain
                             (if the iframe hasn't fully loaded yet, the call will
                             be queued and executed once it has loaded)

                            .Added option for IFrame component to try and detect
                             new global objects such as alerts, tooltips and 
                             pop up windows that are added on top of it and hide the
                             browser iframe temporarily. This option must be
                             explicitly enabled with the overlayDetection property
                             as it's a total hack with no guarantees of working

                            .Added 'debug' property to component that can be
                             used to switch trace statements on and off and
                             changed all traces to go through a logger

                            .Added property "loadIndicatorClass". If this is
                             defined, iframe will create an instance of this
                             class and use it to display a centered indicator
                             over the iframe container while its contents are
                             being loaded by the browser

                            .IFrame will now ensure that it's using a unique
                             id within the application by tracking all IFrame
                             component ids in use with a static var and
                             appending a unique number to the end if needed.
                             This allows use of IFrame within a reusable MXML 
                             component that gets instantiated more than once

 1.3.1     13/10/08  RAB    .Fixed issue where parent document body could be
                             accidentally set to invisible when using content
                             div mode

 1.3.2     20/10/08  RAB    .Added checks for cross-domain security violations.
                             Fixes a problem with hiding and showing iframes with
                             content from a different domain, and will now log
                             a warning in debug mode when attempting to call 
                             a function inside an iframe in a different domain

 1.3.3     05/11/08  RAB    .Fixed issue where iframe in nested ViewStacks (or
                             related components like TabNavigator) could become 
                             visible when it shouldn't.
                            .Debug mode can now be turned on or off at any time
                             instead of being locked in when createChildren runs
                            .Fixed issue with incorrect switching when iframe
                             was created in ViewStack child on the fly due to
                             creationPolicy="auto"

This component is based on the work of:

Christophe Conraets 
www.coenraets.org

and

Brian Deitte

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
I have made some additions to the original code

- javascript support functions are now generated by the component and
inserted directly into the DOM.

- Component generates it's own div and iframe element and inserts them
into the DOM.

- When the component is created the display list is traversed from the 
component down to the root element. At each traversal a test is made to 
see if current component is a container. If it is a container then the 
child of the element which leads back to the component is determined and 
a note madeof the appropriate 'index' on the path. The index is stored 
against a reference to the Container in a Dictionary. Also the container
is 'seeded' with an event handler so that if the container triggers an
IndexChangedEvent.CHANGE (i.e. when you click on a tab in a tab navigator)
the path of 'index' values down to the component can be checked. If the
path indicates that the indexes 'line up' to expose the component then
the view is made visible. I hope I have explained this correctly :)
